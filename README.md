<h1>Active Directory HomeLab </h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/MHsI8hJmggI?si=TnCbCzouDHjERmPt)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, we’re going to walk through how to set up an Active Directory home lab using Oracle VirtualBox. It’s a great hands-on way to get familiar with how Active Directory and Windows networking actually work. I recommend going through it a couple of times to really let it sink in. Don’t hesitate to ask questions if anything’s confusing, and once you’re comfortable, try building it on your own without the guide. Let me know if you need help with anything!
